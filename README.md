# Simon Says Game
A Simon Says game implemented with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project is a modern recreation of the classic memory game, where players replicate a sequence of lights and sounds.

Four interactive buttons with colors: Green, Yellow, Blue, and Red.
Real-time visual feedback with flashing buttons.
Level-based progression and increasing difficulty.
Game over notification with the player's highest score.


# How to Play
Press any key to start the game.
The game will highlight a button. Watch the sequence.
Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons.
The sequence increases with each level.
The game ends when you make a mistake, and your highest score will be displayed.


# JavaScript Game Logic
